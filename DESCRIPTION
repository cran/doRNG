Title: Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for 'foreach' Loops
Version: 1.8.3
Encoding: UTF-8
Authors@R: person("Renaud", "Gaujoux", email = "renozao@protonmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides functions to perform
    reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent
    random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined
    multiple-recursive generator [L'Ecuyer (1999), <DOI:10.1287/opre.47.1.159>].
    It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops into
    fully reproducible loops, independently of the number
    of workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen
    parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
