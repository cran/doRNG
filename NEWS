*************************************************************************

BUG FIX
    o fixed error when running a %dorng% loop on a fresh session, with no  
    parallel backend registered.  

CHANGES
	o improved vignette
	o added more unit tests
    o changed the name of the RNG attribute on result of %dorng% looops from 
    'RNG' to 'rng'. It now contains the whole sequence of RNG seeds, instead of 
    only the first one.
    o RNGseq now accepts a list or a matrix describing the whole sequence of 
    seeds. See vignette for more details.
    o %dorng% loops can be seeded with a complete sequence of seeds passed as a 
    list, a matrix, or an object with attribute 'rng', e.g. the results of 
    %dorng% loops. See vignette for more details.

*************************************************************************

BUG FIX
    o separate %dorng% loops were using the same seed.

NEW FEATURES
    o add unit tests
    o first seed is set as an attribute of the loop's result

CHANGES
    o function doRNGseed now returns the seed to use for the first iteration.
    o RNGseq now change the current RNG state if called with no seed specific.  
    
DEFUNCT
	o removed function CMRGseed

CHANGES
    o use R core RNG "L'Ecuyer-CMRG" and the parallel package, 
    instead of the implementation provided by the rstream package.
